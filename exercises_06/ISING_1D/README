METROPOLIS MONTE CARLO ISING 1D

1) INPUT
Parameters are read from "input.dat" and must be provided in the following order:
  - temperature of the simulation (temp)
  - number of spins (nspin)
  - value of coupling constant (J)
  - value of external magnetic field (h)
  - option to sample using 0 Gibbs or 1 Metropolis (metro)
  - number of Monte Carlo step per block (nstep)
  - number of blocks (nblk)
  - read initial configuration from "config.0": 0 not reading, 1 reading (read_initial)
  - print instant values of observables to help equilibration: 0 not printing, 1 printing (instant_print)
  - verbose option: 0 not printing acceptance every block, 1 printing (verbose)

Note: the temperature value can be provided when the program is launched in the form
            ./Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D [temp]
            
      This option is exploited by the script "run.sh"  to simulate the system at
      consecutive temperature values.


2) OUTPUT
In the output folder are saved:
  - files "output.*.0" for average values of observables in the form
        #Block   Value   Average   Error
  - files "instant.*.0" for instant values of observables
  - file "averages.out" for final values of observables at simulated temperature
  - spin configurations in "frames" folder
The program also saves:
  - "configuration.final" which contains final configurations of the simulation
