GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR TSP

1)INPUT
Parameters are read from "input.dat" and must be provided in the following order:
  - type of geometry for TSP realization: 0 points on a circle,
    1 points inside a square (geometry)
  - number of individuals in the population (npop)
  - number of elite individuals (nelite)
  - number of generation to evolve (ngen)
  - crossover probability (crossover)
  - permutation probability (permutation)
  - total shift probability (tshift)
  - inversion probability (inversion)
  - option to print best configuration at each generation: 0 not printing, 1 printing (print_best)

2)OUTPUT
In the output folder are saved:
  - file "output.length.0" for average values of routes' lengths in the form
        #Generation   Average  Error  Minimal   Maximal
  - xy configuration in "frames" folder that contains positions of the cities in the order
    in which are visited
