LENNARD-JONES SYSTEM MONTE CARLO NVT

1) INPUT
Parameters are read from "input.dat" and must be provided in the following order:
  - temperature of the simulation (temp)
  - number of particles (npart)
  - density (rho)
  - potential cut off distance (rcut)
  - Metropolis step length (delta)
  - number of blocks (nblk)
  - number of timestep per block (nstep)
  - print xyz configurations: 0 not printing, 1 printing (print_xyz)
  - print instant values of observables to help equilibration: 0 not printing, 1 printing (print_instant)

  Note: program reads initial configuration from file "config.0",
        then to restart copy "config.final" to "config.0"

2) OUTPUT
In the output folder are saved:
  - files "output.*.0" for average values of observables in the form
        #Block   Value   Average   Error
  - files "instant.*.0" for instant values of observables
  - xyz configuration in "frames" folder
The program also saves:
  - "configuration.final" and which contains final configurations of the simulation
