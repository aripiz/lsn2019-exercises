PARALLEL SIMULATED ANNEALING

  1)RUN
  mpirun -np [numtasks] ./sa.exe

  2)INPUT
  Parameters are read from "input.dat" and must be provided in the following order:
    - number of cities (ncities)
    - type of geometry for TSP realization: 0 points on a circle,
      1 points inside a square (geometry)
    - number of steps (nstep)
    - initial value of beta (beta)
    - cooling rate (cool)
    - number of steps for each value of beta (ncool)
    - permutation probability (permutation)
    - inversion probability (inversion)
    - option to print best configuration at each generation: 0 not printing, 1 printing (print_best)

  3)OUTPUT
  In the output folder are saved:
    - a file "output.length.*" containing the lengths of each task at every
      step
    - a file "output.length.0" containing the minimal lengths found, corresponding
      step and task
    - a folder "frames" containing the configuration relative to the minimal paths
      found
