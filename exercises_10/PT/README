PARALLEL TEMPERING FOR TSP

  1) RUN
  mpirun -np [numtasks] ./pt.exe

  Note: if [numtasks] does not match the number of replicas and relative
          betas values in input.dat execution stops.

  2) INPUT
  Parameters are read from "input.dat" and must be provided in the following order:
  - number of cities (ncities)
  - type of geometry for TSP realization: 0 points on a circle,
    1 points inside a square (geometry)
  - number of steps (nstep)
  - number of replicas (nbeta)
  - initial value of beta for each replica (beta[i])
  - number of steps between each swap attempt (nswap)
  - permutation probability (permutation)
  - inversion probability (inversion)
  - option to print best configuration at each generation: 0 not printing, 1 printing (print_best)

  3) OUTPUT
  In the output folder are saved:
    - a file "output.length.*" containing the lengths of each replica at every
      step
    - a file "output.length.0" containing the minimal lengths found, corresponding
      step and replica
    - a file "swap.log" containing the step at which a configuration swap
      occurred and the replicas involved
    - a folder "frames" containing the configuration relative to the minimal paths
      found
