SIMULATED ANNEALING FOR TSP

1)INPUT
Parameters are read from "input.dat" and must be provided in the following order:
  - number of cities (ncities)
  - type of geometry for TSP realization: 0 points on a circle,
    1 points inside a square (geometry)
  - number of steps (nstep)
  - initial value of beta (beta)
  - cooling rate (cool)
  - number of steps for each value of beta (ncool)
  - permutation probability (permutation)
  - inversion probability (inversion)
  - option to print best configuration at each generation: 0 not printing, 1 printing (print_best)

2)OUTPUT
In the output folder are saved:
  - file "output.length.0" for average values of routes length in the form
        #Step   Beta  MinimalLength
  - xy configuration in "frames" folder that contains positions of the cities in the order
    in which are visited
